# Changelog – PINE (CatBorg Studio)
## Version 1.21.0

**Release type:** Minor Update  
**Summary:** Navigation system unification, Nav3D integration, and major movement node modernization.

---

### Added
- **MoveTo**
  - Unified movement node supporting `None`, `NavMesh`, and `Nav3D` navigation types.
  - Designed for one-time movement orders toward a fixed destination.
  - Replaces multiple legacy movement nodes with a single, consistent interface.

- **Chase**
  - Continuous target-following node with live target updates.
  - Supports direct movement, Unity NavMesh, and Nav3D volumetric navigation.
  - Intended for dynamic pursuit behaviors.

- **Flee**
  - Reactive avoidance node that moves the agent away from a threat target.
  - Continuously recalculates flee direction based on target movement.
  - Supports `None`, `NavMesh`, and `Nav3D` navigation types.

- **Patrol**
  - Waypoint-based movement node for cyclic or sequential patrol behaviors.
  - Uses the same unified navigation pipeline as other movement nodes.
  - Supports direct movement, NavMesh, and Nav3D.

- **Stop**
  - Immediate movement cancellation node.
  - Halts the currently active navigation system without issuing new movement.
  - Clears NavMeshAgent paths or invokes Nav3D stop logic depending on the selected navigation type.
---

### Changed
- **RandomDestination**
  - Now validates destination reachability when any navigation system is used.
  - Ensures generated destinations are actually reachable before being accepted.
  - Improves stability and correctness of patrol and roaming behaviors.

- **Legacy Movement Nodes**
  The following nodes were marked as `Legacy` and should no longer be used:
  - `Tra_Chase`
  - `Tra_Flee`
  - `Tra_MoveTowards`
  - `Tra_Patrol`
  - `Nav_Chase`
  - `Nav_Flee`
  - `Nav_MoveTowards`
  - `Nav_Patrol`

  Users should migrate to the new unified nodes listed in **Added**.

---

### Improved
- **Navigation Architecture**
  - Unified navigation logic across all movement-related nodes.
  - Consistent behavior and state handling between `None`, `NavMesh`, and `Nav3D`.

- **Behaviour Tree Editor**
  - Added visual indicators showing whether the user is inspecting the Executor or the Behaviour Tree asset.
  - Improved clarity when editing runtime instances versus tree assets.
  - Added node search when opening the right-click menu, allowing users to type node names directly instead of browsing categories.

---

### Removed
- No nodes were physically removed in this release.
  - Legacy movement nodes remain available for compatibility but are deprecated and hidden by default.
